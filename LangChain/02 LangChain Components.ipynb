    "Now, if you watch today's video completely, then going forward, you will get two benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will get a very deep insight into how LangChain is organized as a framework. You will understand the thought process of the people who built this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the second benefit will be that going forward, all the videos I will be uploading in this playlist will be based on today's video.  That means, the components I have discussed in this video will be the basis for the detailed videos you will see in the future. So, by watching this video, you will get a kind of roadmap of what we will be covering in this playlist. Okay, now before starting the video, I would like to give a disclaimer that in today's video, we will not be doing any coding or building any projects. And the reason behind that is very simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "I told you before starting this playlist that generally, I have observed that in all the resources available online about LangChain, people start building projects directly without giving a proper foundation of LangChain. And I think that's not the right way to learn this library. I think the right way is to first get a conceptual overview of the library and then start coding. So, in this playlist too, I have planned the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first two videos, the previous one and today's video, will provide you with a theoretical foundation about the library. Once this foundation is set, we will do coding and build projects in all the subsequent lectures. That is why, in this video too, I have planned not to include any kind of code. But this doesn't mean that this video will be boring. I have made sure that while explaining each component, I give you very interesting and relevant industrial examples, and most likely, you won't find this video boring.\n",

    "Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now guys, before starting the video, I would like to give you a quick recap of the previous video. The previous video was the first video in this playlist, and there I tried to explain to you in quite detail what LangChain is and why it is needed. Okay, so I told you there that LangChain is an open-source framework with the help of which you can build LLM-powered applications. Then we discussed why LangChain was needed. There I gave you an example that we want to build an application where anyone can interact with a PDF, and then I tried to explain to you through a system design how many components would be involved in building such a system, and there would be many interactions between those components. \n",
    "\n",
    "And if someone wants to code such a system from scratch, they will have to put in a lot of effort. And then I explained to you how LangChain comes into the picture, and the biggest advantage of this entire complexity is that LangChain can efficiently orchestrate all these components, build pipelines, and you get maximum output with very minimal code. I also told you that LangChain has the concept of chains, where you can string together different components in a chain, and the biggest beauty of chains is that the output of one component automatically\n",
    "serves as the input for the next component, and we don't need to code this manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also told you about another feature: how LangChain is a model-agnostic framework, which means that if tomorrow you want to use Google's Gemini models instead of OpenAI's GPT models, you don't need to change much code. Literally, it will be done in one or two lines of code. So I told you about all these benefits in the last video. I also explained what people are using LangChain for these days. \n",
    "\n",
    "I gave you examples of how many people are creating conversational chatbots for their companies, many are building AI knowledge assistants, and many companies have now jumped into creating AI agents. We covered all of this discussion in the last video, and I really hope you watched that video. If you haven't watched that video, I would recommend that you please go back and watch it.\n",

    "What are the different components in LangChain? Okay, so first of all, I would like to show you this diagram because in this diagram I have listed down all the components. So in total, LangChain has six different components, and if you understand these six components, trust me, you will understand the majority of the concepts of LangChain. Okay? \n",
    "\n",
    "So the first component is Models, the second is Prompts, the third is Chains, the fourth is Memory, the fifth is Indexes, and the sixth is Agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this video is to discuss each of these components in detail, one by one, and you will notice later in this playlist that we will be talking about these six components throughout this entire playlist. Okay? So now let's start with our first component, which is Models.\n",

    "So guys, Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll study the Models component in detail because it's the most important component of LangChain. Look here, it says, \"In LangChain, models are the core interface through which you interact with AI.\" Models. Now, I know you won't understand much from this definition, so to explain things better, let me give you a little backstory. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the entire history of NLP, there was one particular application that everyone wanted to build, and that was a chatbot. Chatbots are probably the most popular application in the world of NLP. Everyone wants to build their own chatbot in NLP. But there were two major problems in building chatbots. Not anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first problem was making the chatbot understand the user's query. Right? I typed, \"Hi, can you check my email now?\"  Making the chatbot understand what I meant was the first big challenge in building a chatbot, and we call this NLU, Natural Language Understanding. This is the challenge. The second challenge is that even if the chatbot understands what I'm asking it, making it reply is also a big challenge. So, basically, context-aware text generation is also a big challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "And a lot of effort was put into both of these challenges, a lot of attempts were made to solve them. Eventually, LLMs came along, and LLMs solved both of these problems together. So, to train LLMs, we used almost the entire internet's data, which resulted in not only the development of an understanding of natural language within the LLMs, but at the same time, they also gained the capability of context-aware text generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what I mean is that after the arrival of LLMs, these two major problems of NLP were solved simultaneously. Okay? But a new problem came into the picture. The new problem was that since LLMs are trained on the entire internet's data, they have a lot of parameters, like billions Of the parameters that make the size of LLMs huge, like really huge, I mean, many of the good LLMs in the market have a size greater than 100GB. \n",

    "Now, the problem is that a normal person cannot run such large files on their computer. For that matter, even small companies cannot run them on their servers because the cloud bill would be so high that you wouldn't be able to pay it. So, this was the second major challenge that arose after the arrival of LLMs. This challenge was also solved with the help of APIs. So, what big companies like OpenAI and Google did was they kept the LLM files on their servers and created an API. Now, anyone in the world can hit these APIs, send their queries, and these APIs will communicate with the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM will give its response back, and that response will be received by the user. Now, what is the advantage of this model? I don't have to run the LLM on my computer or on my cloud services. I will send as many questions to the API as I need, and I will only have to pay for that usage. So, this problem was also solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "But now a third problem came into the picture, and that problem was implementation.  Different LLM providers wrote their APIs in different ways, which means if I am an application developer and I need to communicate with two different LLM APIs in my application, I will have to write different types of code. Let me show you something here. Pay attention here; two pieces of code are written here. \n",

    "This first code is for OpenAI. If I want to communicate with OpenAI's GPT model, with their API, this is the code for that. And this code is for the Claude API. If I want to talk to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet, this is the code to communicate with its API. And you can already see that there are slight differences, so if I need to use both LLMs in the same application for different purposes, I have to write two different types of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, let's say I built an application, and initially, I built it using OpenAI, and I wrote this code. Now, suddenly, I don't want to use the OpenAI API anymore because it's expensive, and I want to use the Claude API. Then I'll have to change my code base and convert it, which is a lot of work. So, basically, standardization becomes a challenge. Gemini's APIs behave differently, OpenAI's APIs behave differently, and Claude's APIs behave differently. Even the response I'm getting back is of a different type. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, LangChain identified this problem and created a model component, which is basically an interface that allows anyone to interact with any company's API in a standardized fashion. This means you don't have to make many changes to the code, and you can immediately communicate with OpenAI, and with a few changes to the code, you can also communicate with Gemini. So, that's the model component. \n",

These are models that you give text as input, but they give you a vector as output. We discussed this in the last video. And their main use case is semantic search. I also told you about this in the last video. Okay? So, LangChain can communicate with both of these types of models. It can be done with language models and also with embedding models. \n",

For example, whether the tools calling feature is available or not (tools calling is useful when you create an agent), whether you get structured output from the model, whether you get output in JSON mode, whether you can run that model locally on your machine, whether you can provide multimodal input – all of this is given here.

In a nutshell, if I can summarize, the model component is basically an interface that allows you to communicate with AI models, and the biggest problem this interface or component solves is that it addresses the previous limitations. Different APIs and LLMs were all doing their own thing. This particular component standardizes the whole process so that you can communicate with any LLM provider with just a few code changes.

For example, if you are working on ChatGPT and you ask ChatGPT the question, \"What is CampusX?\", this string, \"What is CampusX?\", can be called a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, prompts are very, very important in the world of LLMs. The output of an LLM depends heavily on the prompts. In fact, it's very sensitive. This means that if you change the prompts even slightly, the LLM's output changes significantly.\n",

Suppose you asked an LLM, \"Explain linear regression in an academic tone,\" and then you asked the same LLM another question, \"Explain linear regression in a fun tone.\" You will notice that you only changed one word, but the output of your LLM will be very different. So, prompts are super important.\n",

    "\n",
    "And this is such an important component that LangChain is named after it. Okay, so let me explain it to you. What are chains and what can they do? So, chains are basically a component that allows us to build pipelines in LangChain.\n",
    "So basically, the idea is that you can take any LLM application you build and give it the shape of a pipeline, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "And that pipeline can be built using chains. Okay, let me explain it with an example. Let's say you want to build an LLM application where the user gives you a large English text as input, around 1000 words, and in the output, you need to provide a Hindi summary of it in less than 100 words. This is the LLM application you need to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so you decided that the flow of this entire LLM application will be that you will first receive the input. You will first send this input to an LLM, and the job of this LLM will be to translate this input into Hindi. So, translation is happening here. After that, we will send this translated text to a second LLM, and this LLM will generate a Hindi summary of it in less than 100 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you have decided this flow for your LLM application. Now you can easily represent this flow in the form of a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay? Now, if you don't use chains, what you will have to do is design this entire pipeline manually. Which means you will take input from the user, then you will call this LLM, provide the input to it, and tell it to translate it into Hindi. You will get the Hindi translation, and then you will take that, go to another LLM, and tell it to generate a summary of this Hindi translation in Hindi, and Then you will get your final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you design this entire pipeline manually, you have to manually extract the output from each stage and feed it into the input of the next stage. Chains solve this problem. What do chains do? The biggest advantage of chains is that they automatically make the output of one stage the input of the next stage, and you don't need to write any manual code for this. Which means, if you build this entire task using chains, you simply need to provide an English text here and call the chain, and behind the scenes, all these tasks will be executed automatically, and you will directly get your result here. You don't need to worry about manually feeding the output of LLM 1 into LLM 2. Chains are doing all this heavy lifting behind the scenes. \n",

The first is the Document Loader, the second is the Text Splitter, the third is the Vector Store, and the fourth is the Retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four things together make up indexes. Now let's have a detailed discussion about what indexes are and why they are needed. So, you use ChatGPT for all your queries, right? And ChatGPT mostly gives you answers to all your queries because it has been trained on data from the entire internet, so it knows most things. But there are certain scenarios where ChatGPT will not be able to answer you. \n",

    "For example, I work at a company called XYZ. Now, if I go to ChatGPT and ask ChatGPT, \"Can you tell me what is the leave policy of my company XYZ?\" or if I go and ask, \"What is the notice period policy of my company XYZ?\" Do you think ChatGPT will be able to answer this question? The answer is no. Since these questions are asked about my company's private data, ChatGPT will not be able to answer it because ChatGPT did not see this data during its training. \n",

    "So, this is a problem we all face: we cannot ask ChatGPT questions related to the things we are doing in our private and professional lives because obviously, ChatGPT doesn't know about them. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, is there a solution? The answer is yes. What you can do is connect your LLM to an external knowledge source. For example, I can take an LLM and provide it with the entire rulebook of my XYZ company. Okay? Now, if I ask a normal question like, \"Who is the Prime Minister of India?\", the LLM will answer it because it has seen all this during its training. But if I ask, let's say, \"What is the leave policy of XYZ company?\", it will also answer that because it now has this external knowledge source. Okay? \n",

It says, \"LLM API calls are stateless.\" And this is a big problem. When you build LLM-based applications, you'll understand that when you make API calls to an LLM, all those calls are stateless. What does this mean? \n",

    "Let me explain with an example. Let's say I'm using an LLM API, for example, I'm using the OpenAI API and interacting with the GPT model. I sent this question to the model: \"Who is Narendra Modi?\" The model quickly replied, \"Narendra Modi is an Indian politician who is the current Prime Minister of India.\" \n",

    "Now, let's see how this AI agent will handle this query. So, since it has reasoning capabilities, it means it can reason about exactly what it needs to do. Okay? So, reasoning happens through different techniques here. There are many popular techniques, and one of the very popular techniques is Chain of Thought prompting, where your AI agent will break down your query step by step and then try to reason through it. \n",

    "For example, as soon as the AI ​​agent reads this query, \"Can you multiply today's temperature of Delhi by three?\", it will first break down this query step by step. It will say that I need to multiply today's temperature of Delhi by three, which means I need today's temperature of Delhi. And as soon as I get the temperature, I can multiply it by three. Okay? \n",
    "\n",
    "Now its entire focus will shift to finding today's temperature of Delhi. So it will go and check if it has any tool that can tell it the temperature of Delhi. It will notice that yes, it has a weather API. So it will quickly hit the weather API and give the input \"Delhi\" to the weather API.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will respond with the result, saying 25 degrees Celsius. Now your agent will say, \"I have the temperature of Delhi, and I need to multiply this number, 25 degrees Celsius, by 3. But to perform this operation, I need a calculator.\" So it will go back and check its tools to see if it has access to a calculator. The answer is yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it will quickly call the calculator and give it the inputs 25, 3, and the multiplication operation. These three inputs will go into the calculator. The calculator will respond with 75, and this 75 will finally become your output. And this is how AI agents work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so basically, to summarize, the only difference between an AI agent and a chatbot is that an AI agent has reasoning capabilities and access to tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "So an AI agent is just an evolved form of a chatbot where you can perform some actions with the help of AI agents because it has reasoning capabilities and access to tools. Okay? \n",

    "I hope you understood. It's a very interesting topic, and it seems like all the big companies and all the good researchers in the world of AI are converging on this topic. And I'm pretty sure that in the next one to one and a half years, there will be a lot of progress on this front. So we will discuss this in quite a lot of detail.\n",

    "LangChain has made it very easy to create AI agents, and we will show you how to create an AI agent. So with that, this concludes our introduction to all the components. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will study each of these components in detail, one by one. For example, in our next video, we will look at the first component, the models, in quite a lot of detail. Okay?\n",
