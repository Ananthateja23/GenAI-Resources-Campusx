Today we are taking the first step in that journey and today we are launching the first playlist of that entire roadmap. And the topic of this playlist is a very important topic, and that topic is called LangChain. \n",

After that, I told you about three ways you can improve the response from an LLM: prompt engineering, RAG, and fine-tuning. Then I told you about a completely new field originating from all of this, which we call agentic AI, and besides that, LLMOps and some miscellaneous topics also come under this particular curriculum.\n",

    "What is Langchain? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, I'd like to explain what LangChain is.  In very simple terms, LangChain is a framework that helps you build any LLM-based application.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM-based applications mean applications like chatbots, agents, etc. You can build these very easily with the help of LangChain. Look, it says here, LangChain is an open-source framework that helps in building LLM-based applications. It provides modular components and end-to-end tools that help developers build complex applications such as chatbots, question answering systems, RAG-based applications, autonomous agents, and much more. So, in a nutshell, that's the definition of LangChain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I'll tell you about some core features that have made LangChain so popular and why you should learn it. So, the biggest advantage of LangChain is that it supports almost all major LLMs, whether open-source or closed-source, it doesn't matter. LangChain has integration for every LLM, whether it's OpenAI's, GPT models, or Anthropic's Claude models, or Google's models. Other than this a lot of open source models in hugging face. Connect with everyone easily with the help of Langchain. This is the most important feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second feature is that it simplifies LLM... Simplifying the development of LLM-based applications. So there are some very interesting things in LangChain that help you easily build LLM-based applications. For example, there's a concept called Chains, which allows you to build very complex pipelines. And with the help of those pipelines, you can create complex applications. So, many such things are available in LangChain that greatly help you in building LLM-based applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third feature is that LangChain has many types of integrations available. So, in the process of building LLM-based applications, you have to connect with many tools. For example, you need to connect with your database or work with a remote data source, or connect it with a deployment. \n",
    "So, LangChain has written wrappers with the help of which you can easily connect with all these tools and services. You don't need to write a lot of boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay? Fourth is that LangChain is free. This is a very big reason behind the widespread adoption of LangChain,that LangChain is a free, open-source package, and it is being very actively developed at this point. In fact, within one or two years, three different versions of LangChain have been released. So, a lot of work is going on, and many new components are added here on a daily basis. So, this is a very big reason why LangChain is becoming so popular in the Gen AI community.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, it supports all major Gen AI use cases, meaning Generative AI. The variety of applications that can be created, such as chatbots,\n",
    "agents, and RAG-based applications – LangChain helps you in building all of these. So, it's kind of an all-rounder player, right?\n",
    "These are the reasons why LangChain has become so popular, and you should definitely learn LangChain.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why LangChain First? \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to discuss why I decided to teach LangChain first in this entire user-side curriculum. So if you look at this entire curriculum, there are many things you need to learn, but LangChain is a good starting point because if you learn LangChain first, you can get a taste of other things as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you can do other things with LangChain. For example, with the help of LangChain, you can work with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. You can work with LLM APIs, you can integrate with Hugging Face, you can also integrate with Ollama in LangChain, plus you'll get a little taste of prompt engineering when you learn LangChain. You can develop RAG applications and you can also create AI agents. In fact, I'll show you a little bit of how you can get a taste of LLM Ops with the help of LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so this was the reason why I thought it was right to start with teaching LangChain, because by learning LangChain, you get a complete holistic view of this entire user-side landscape. You get to work on a little bit of everything. It will come. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we complete LangChain, after that, we will revisit these topics again. For example, after completing LangChain, my plan is to create a complete playlist for you on prompt engineering. Okay? Then my plan is that later on, I will create a complete playlist for you on RAGs and advanced RAG techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay? So this is my plan: first, get a holistic view of the entire thing, and then, one by one, we will cover all the other things in detail in separate playlists. That is why LangChain is my first choice.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first part, we will cover the fundamentals of LangChain, okay? And this is the most important part because if you don't learn this, then obviously the things that follow will not make sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part is where we will learn to build RAG applications, and in the third part, we will learn to build AI agents, okay? So if I show you a little more details, I have written down the curriculum here, exactly which topics the videos will be on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Part One is Fundamentals, where in the first video we will cover what LangChain is, and I will give you a very detailed overview of LangChain, I will tell you about its technical aspects, and most importantly, I will tell you why LangChain is needed, okay? The second video will be on LangChain components. This will again be an overview video where we will have a detailed discussion about all the components in LangChain. After that, from the third module onwards, we will start doing practical things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third module will be around models, all the different types of models, How to integrate with LangChain, how to get responses from them, \n",
    "we will cover all of that here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth video will be on prompts. We will discuss different types of techniques around prompts. The fourth video would be around parsing output. \n",
    "The output that comes from LLMs can be parsed in different ways, so we will cover that in this video. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, there is a technical aspect of LangChain which we call Runnables and LCEL or LCL. We will cover this. \n",
    "After that, a very important video will come on Chains, which I told you about earlier. We will cover this in video number seven. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, how to integrate memory concepts in chatbots etc, we will cover that. So, these entire seven or eight videos will be in your fundamentals. After that, we will move on to the RAG part where we will study document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, vector databases, retrievers, and when we have studied all this, finally we will build a RAG application from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, we will study about agents where we will cover tools and toolkits. We will learn what kits are, we will look at the concept of tool calling, and then after studying all of this, we will finally create an AI agent. So at this point in this playlist, I am planning that there will be around 17 videos, but over time it's possible that one or two more videos might be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay? So this playlist will roughly have 17-18 videos. Okay? So this is the curriculum that we are going to follow.\n",

    "My main focus in creating this entire playlist is to provide you with the most up-to-date information about LangChain. So, at this point, if you go to the LangChain website, you'll see that they have three versions: 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 . And the interesting thing is that these three versions are quite different from each other. So, if you'velearned version 0.1, it's possible that you won't understand many things in version .3. My goal will be to deliver the entire playlist based on the most updated, the latest version, 0.3. So you will have the most up-to-date information.I will also guide you a little bit about 0.2 and 0.1 along the way,but the entire playlist will be based on LangChain version 3.This is my first focus area.\n",
    "\n",
    "My second focus area is clarity. I want to make sure that you get clarity throughout this entire playlist.I've seen content on LangChain on YouTube and Udemy, but I felt it wasn't beginner-friendly. I've seen a lot of other content around it as well. What happens is that even if you code along, copy the code, and your application runs, you don't have conceptual clarity in your mind about how this whole thing works, what's happening behind the scenes in LangChain. So I will try to provide you with that in this playlist. The videos will be a bit detailed. Even though there are 17 videos, there's a good chance that each video will be 30-40 minutes long. Okay?\n",
    "\n",
    "My third goal will be to impart conceptual understanding to you. LangChain is a practical thing, a framework, with the help of which... You'll be building applications, but there are some concepts involved, such as the concept of runnables or the concept of chains.I want to explain these concepts to you so that even if LangChain is replaced by LangChain 4 in the future, you won't have much trouble learning it.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, we will cover around 80% of LangChain. I'm not covering 100% because the entire 100% isn't useful. So, we will cover the most useful 80% of LangChain. In the future, if I feel that some other things have become important, I will update this playlist. But right now, my focus is on covering the most important 80% of LangChain. So, this will be my focus throughout this entire playlist.\n",

So, roughly speaking, it will take us two months to cover this entire playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, it won't be possible to do it any faster because I'm also working on other things on the channel. I have to continue the PyTorch playlist, and then we also have to move to the builder side.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's why, for now, I think two videos per week is a good speed. You'll also get some time to practice. So yeah, these are the things I wanted to discuss in this video. I think I've told you everything that was on my mind, and I'm sure you're excited because I'm very excited. As I said in the last video, my biggest motivation is curiosity, and I myself want to learn a lot about this entire technology. So LangChain is a good starting point. Once you learn LangChain well, you'll be able to build many kinds of generative AI applications. So in that sense, LangChain is very empowering.\n",
